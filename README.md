## How to play

Click 'New game' to create a new game and wait for someone to join, or 'Join' to join the oldest game in the queue. If you want to play with someone in particular, one of you should create a game and the other should join inmediately after, when the queue is empty :)

Each player is assigned 10 random cards, and always have 3 on their hand. During their turn, a player can do one of the following actions:

 - Move a card from their hand to one of their slots on the board (clicking on the card and then on the slot).
 - Click the button to reset the active skill.
 - Select one of their card on the board and then select one card of the opponent to attack it The losing card (the one with less points in the active skill) will be destroyed.

 The player who runs out of cards first loses. Good luck!

 ## Other stuff

 If you are wondering why the word "Character" is on top of all the cards, or why they have tags at the bottom, it is because event cards - which would affect all cards with a certain tag - are planned but not implemented. (They might or might not be implemented Soonâ„¢)
